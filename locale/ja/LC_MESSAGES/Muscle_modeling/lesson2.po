"some of the values."

"The first thing we shall try is to make the muscle bulge. We do this by "
"setting the value of the Bulge variable to 1. What this transates to is "
"to make the muscle bulging proportional to the force in the muscle:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../Muscle_modeling/lesson2.rst:90
msgid ""
"When you try this, you will find that the muscle has become thinner, but "
"you really cannot see it bulge much. The problem is that the thickness of"
" the muscle is scaled by another factor in addition to the force. This "
"enables the system to create nice visualizations for intensive and light "
"exercises alike. The additional factor is the variable MaxStress. The "
"following will increase the muscle thickness:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../Muscle_modeling/lesson2.rst:112
msgid ""
"Why does a smaller value of MaxStress lead to a thicker muscle? Well, you"
" can think of the force in a muscle as being the product of a tissue "
"stress and the cross sectional area. So, the smaller the tissue stress, "
"the larger the cross sectional area for a given force. Thus, reducing the"
" value of MaxStress increases the muscle thickness. If you reload and run"
" the inverse dynamic analysis you will see that the muscle now has a "
"significant thickness. Its thickness does not change much over the "
"movement, though. This is because the muscle force is nearly constant "
"over time for the problem we have defined. If we let the joint flex a bit"
" more, then the moment arm of the muscle will become progressively "
"smaller, and we will get a larger muscle force. The easy way to "
"accomplish this is to increase the angular velocity of the joint driver:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../Muscle_modeling/lesson2.rst:138
msgid ""
"Reload the model and run the InverseDynamicAnalysis operation again. You "
"will see that the arm now flexes up to an almost vertical position. If "
"you plot the muscle force, Fm, again in a chart view, then you can see "
"how the muscle force goes up drastically with the reduced moment arm:"

#: ../../Muscle_modeling/lesson2.rst:145
