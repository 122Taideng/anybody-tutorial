"The Kinematics operation has a short and a very long explanation. The "
"short explanation is that it makes the model perform whichever movement "
"you have imposed on it by the drivers you have defined in the model. And "
"it only does the movement. There is no calculation of forces involved, "
"and the system does not even have to be properly balanced to be subjected"
" to the Kinematics operation. However, it does have to be kinematically "
"determinate, but that concept is definitely a part of the longer "
"explanation."

"An AnyBody model is really a collection of rigid segments. You can think "
"of them as a bunch of potatoes floating around in space. Technically, "
"each potato is called a \"rigid body\", but the term \"body\" can be "
"misinterpreted in the context of a body modeling system like AnyBody, so "
"we call them \"segments\"."

"When a segment flows around in space, it can move in six different "
"directions. We call them degrees of freedom and usually think of them as "
"movement along the three coordinate axes and rotation about the same "
"axes. We call these movement directions \"degrees of freedom\" and an "
"unconstrained segment in space has six degrees of freedom. If we have n "
"segments in the model, the model will have a total of 6n degrees of "
"freedom unless some of them are constrained somehow. The purpose of the "
"kinematic analysis is to determine the position of all the segments at "
"all times, and this requires 6n pieces of information about the positions"
" to resolve the 6n degrees of freedom. The pieces of information are "
"mathematically speaking equations. So kinematic analysis is about solving"
" 6n equations with 6n unknowns."

"A usual way of constraining degrees of freedom (or adding equations to "
"the system) is to add joints to the model. When you join two segments "
"they lose some of their freedom to move independently. They become "
"constrained to each other. Consider two segments joined at their ends by "
"a ball-and-socket joint. They are now under the constraints that the x, y"
" and z coordinates of the joined points must be the same. In other words,"
" a ball-and-socket joint adds three constraints or three equations to the"
" system."

msgid ""
"If you add enough joints to the system to provide all 6n constraints, "
"then it might be mathematically possible to solve the equations and find "
"the position of all the segments. But the result would not be very "
"exciting because the system would not be able to move. Usually a body "
"model will have enough joints to keep the segments together but few "
"enough to let the model move. After all, movement is what most higher "
"organisms do. So where do the remaining constraints or equations come "
"from? They are the drivers. When the joints have eaten up their part of "
"the degrees-of-freedom, enough drivers must be added to resolve the "
"remaining unknowns in the system up to the required number of 6n. When "
"the AnyBody Modeling System performs the Kinematics operation, these "
"drivers are taken through their sequences of values, and the positions of"
" all the segments are resolved for each time step by solving the 6n "
"equations."

"When the model is set up in such a way that it has 6n equations and these"
" equations can be solved, then it is said to be kinematically "
"determinate. Usually this is necessary to perform the kinematic analysis."
" We say \"usually\" because there are a few exceptions where the system "
"can be solved even when the number of equations is different from 6n. "
"There are also some cases where the system cannot be solved even though "
"there are 6n equations available. Both cases are connected with redundant"
" constraints."

"If you define two or more constraints that in some way constrain exactly "
"the same degrees of freedom in the same way, then they are redundant. For"
" instance, you might by mistake repeat the definition of a joint. You "
"will then have two joints that work exactly the same, and the equations "
"provided by those two joints will be redundant. You will see them when "
"you count constraints, but they will not have much effect."

"The AnyBody Modeling System can sometimes cope with models that have too "
"many constraints as long as those constraints are not conflicting, i.e., "
"some of them are redundant. But it is a good rule to make sure that you "
"have the same number of degrees-of-freedom and constraints."

"If you have too many constraints and they are incompatible, then the "
"system is kinematically over-determinate. If you have too few "
"constraints, or some of the constraints are redundant, then the system "
"may be kinematically indeterminate. Both cases are likely to prevent the "
"Kinematics operation to complete."

"Actually, even when you have a kinematically indeterminate system, the "
"Kinematics operation can fail. This is actually very easy to picture. "
"Sometimes the segments of the model may be configured such that they "
"cannot reach each other, or in such a way that they interlock. The real "
"world is full of that sort of mechanisms: Car doors that get stuck or "
"refuse to close, locks that will not unlock, or stacked glasses that "
"wedge inseparably into each other. Computer systems that model the real "
"world will have them too, and just like the real world it can sometimes "
"be difficult to find out what the problem is."

"Notice that kinematic analysis determines velocities and accelerations in"
" addition to positions. The position analysis is by far the more "
"challenging because the equations are nonlinear, whereas solution for "
"velocity and acceleration involves linear equations once the positions "
"have been determined. Please notice also that due to the very general "
"approach used by the AnyBody Modeling System, it handles closed kinematic"
" chains. This is crucial in biomechanics where closed chains occur very "
"frequently, for instance in bicycling, gait, and whenever the model grabs"
" something with both hands."
