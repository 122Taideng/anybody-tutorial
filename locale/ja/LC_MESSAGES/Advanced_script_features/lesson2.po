"If you have any sort of experience with C or C++ programming, then the "
"concept of include files will be very familiar to you. The idea behind "
"include files is very simple: You divide one long file into several "
"smaller ones. This is primarily useful, if the division into smaller "
"files is based on some logical principle. Simple as it may be, it enables"
" some pretty neat model structures that can really help your work."

msgid ""
"Usually, the structure of files in a model is such that one file is the "
"main file (containing the Main folder), and the main file contains "
"statements to include other files. An include file can include other "
"files and so on."

"Consider, for instance, the case of one very large AnyScript model. If "
"you have the model in a single .any file, then it may be difficult to "
"locate a particular muscle or another element that you are looking for. "
"Instead, you could choose to put all the muscle definitions into a "
"separate file. At the position in the main file where you removed the "
"muscle information, you simply add a statement to include the new muscle "
"file called muscles.any. The statement could look like this:"

"Notice the leading # symbol. It signifies that this is a macro statement,"
" and it is the only type of statement in AnyScript that does not require "
"a semicolon in the end. This is because the statement is not formally a "
"part of the AnyScript language. It is something that is processed before "
"the actual model is parsed."

#: ../../Advanced_script_features/lesson2.rst:36
msgid ""
"When the system loads the model and reaches the include statement, it "
"simply reads the include file, and subsequently continues reading the "
"main file. It is a very simple principle, but it does have some "
"interesting implications:"

"You can create blocks of data that are easy to re-use in your model. "
"Simply put the data in a file and include that same file several times at"
" different positions in your the main file. For instance, if you have "
"modeled two arms, you might want to use the same set of muscles for both "
"of them. In that case, create one file containing the muscles and include"
" it twice."

msgid ""
"You can create libraries of files containing elements you often use in "
"your modeling tasks, and when you build a new model much of the work is "
"accomplished simply by including the files you have made previously. It "
"is much like constructing models from larger building blocks."
