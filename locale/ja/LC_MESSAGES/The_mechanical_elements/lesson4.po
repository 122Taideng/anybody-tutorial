"You are not likely to have any sort of idea what a kinematic measure is. "
"Don't worry - you're not supposed to know about it. The concept was "
"invented by AnyBody Technology as a way of describing dimensions in a "
"kinematic model that you might want to get information about or control "
"with drivers. A joint angle or a distance between two points are examples"
" of kinematic measures. The position of the center of gravity of the "
"entire model or a subset of its segments are other examples."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you define a kinematic measure in your model, then you can study its "
"development. But more importantly you can control it. You can add a "
"driver to a kinematic measure, and that way control the movement of the "
"mechanism. Such a driver can be added even when the measure is a less "
"tangible quantity like the collective center of gravity that is not "
"attached to a particular segment."

"Joints can be understood as kinematic measures equipped with drivers. For"
" instance, a spherical joint is a distance between two points on two "
"different segments that is driven to be zero. This means that, using "
"kinematic measures, you can define types of joints that are not available"
" as predefined objects in AnyScript."

"Do you remember the simple arm example of the \":doc:`Getting Started: "
"AnyScript Programming <../A_Getting_started_anyscript/intro>`\" tutorial?"
" That was a 2-D model of an arm where we produced the movement by driving"
" the angles of the shoulder and elbow joints directly."

"But let us imagine that we wanted the hand to reach out and grab "
"something at a specific position. It would probably be difficult to "
"figure out precisely how to drive the two joint angles to put the hand in"
" the position we wanted it to attain. Instead, we would want to be able "
"to put the hand (actually the wrist since this simple model has no hand) "
"directly at the desired position in space and have the elbow and shoulder"
" joints follow implicitly. This is where the kinematic measures come into"
" play. Let's start off with the model just about where we left in the "
"\"Getting Started with AnyScript\" tutorial. Please :download:`click here"
" to download the necessary file (Measures.any) <Downloads/Measures.any>`,"
" and save it in some working directory on your own hard disk."

"Let us try initially to create a kinematic measure that will allow us to "
"track the movement of the wrist. To honor the folder structure of the "
"model we shall create a new folder for the kinematic measure. Let's place"
" it just below the Jnts folder to reflect the kinship between kinematic "
"measures and joints:"

"An AnyKinLinear is a kinematic measure that gauges the spatial vector "
"between two points. The line Ref = 0 means that the coordinates of this "
"linear distance are measured in the coordinate system first of the "
"measure's end points which in this case happens to be the global "
"reference frame. For other options, please refer to the AnyScript "
"Reference Manual."

"So far, we have just added a measure that allows us to track the movement"
" of the hand, but it is still driven by the joint drivers as before. "
"Let's investigate what we have. Load the model and run a "
"KinematicAnalysis or an InverseDynamicAnalysis, and subsequently open a "
"ChartFX view."

"The next step is to fill drivers for the WristPos measure into the "
"Drivers folder. We initially make an empty skeleton. Notice that we are "

"by a motion tracking technology and wanted to reproduce the movement, you"

"The first of the red lines above refers to the WristPos kinematic "
"measure. It simply specifies that this is the measure we want to drive. "
"Notice, however that this measure has three components, namely the x, y "
"and z coordinates. But we only want to drive two of them. The "
"MeasureOrganizer handles that problem. It lines up the coordinates of the"
" measure in a row for driving. MeasureOrganizer = {0,1} means that the "
"vectors of driver specifications, such as DriverPos and DriverVel, refer "
"to the x (number 0) and y (number 1) coordinates of the measure."
msgstr ""

#: ../../The_mechanical_elements/lesson4.rst:162
msgid ""
"The values we suggest for DriverPos and DriverVel have been found by "
"inspection of the graphs depicted above showing the development of the "
"measure coordinates when we used the shoulder and elbow drivers. This is "
"good practice because it is so easy to specify wrist positions that the "
"arm cannot reach and thereby provoke a kinematic incompatibility that may"
" be difficult to find in more complex cases."

"To conclude, the special feature about kinematic measures is that you can"
" drive them. In AnyBody, you can drive anything that you can measure, and"
