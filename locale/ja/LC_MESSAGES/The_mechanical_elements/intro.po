"Musculoskeletal modeling is really just an advanced application of the "
"laws of mechanics described by one of the greatest scientists of all "
"times, Sir Isaac Newton, more than 300 years ago. So the elements of the "
"models you are working on in the AnyBody Modeling System are mostly "
"mechanical in nature, and to use them you must have sound understanding "
"of the laws of mechanics in general and of Newton's three laws of motion "
"in particular."
