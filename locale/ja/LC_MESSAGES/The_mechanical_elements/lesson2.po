"You normally think of a joint as something that provides the body with "
"its movement capability. We interpret joints that way because we would "
"not be able to move if our joints were rigid. But there is also an "
"opposite perception of a joint: as a constraint. If we did not have "
"joints, then our bodies would disconnect into a heap of bones."
msgstr ""

#: ../../The_mechanical_elements/lesson2.rst:13
msgid ""
"The latter perception is how joints really work in AnyBody. Imagine you "
"have two segments with no joints at all. They each have 6 degrees of "
"freedom in space: 3 translations and 3 rotations. So two disjoint "
"segments give us 12 degrees of freedom. If we connect them by a ball and "
"socket joint, then we eliminate 3 degrees of freedom because they can no "
"longer translate freely with respect to each other, and we are left with "
"a mechanism with 12 - 3 = 9 degrees of freedom. AnyBody will keep rack of"
" all this for you, but it makes things much easier to understand if you "
"get used to thinking of joints as constraints."

"As a final word about perceiving joints as constraints, it might be worth"
" mentioning that these constraints are not taken into account at the "
"moment when you load a model into AnyBody. By that time, the segments are"
" simply positioned in space where you located them in their definition. "
"In principle, the segments may be in one big, disorganized heap."

msgid ""
"The joint constraints are not imposed until you perform some sort of "
"analysis. Each study has the SetInitialConditions operation for the "
"particular purpose of resolving the constraints and connecting things. "
"The mathematics of that is a nonlinear system of equations. Such a system"
" may have multiple solutions or no solutions at all. Even if it has a "
"unique solution, it may de impossible to find. This means that if the "
"segments are too disorganized from their final positions when they are "
"defined, then the system might not be able to resolve the constraints and"
" put them in their correct positions. The remedy is to define the "
"segments so that their initial positions are not too far away from the "
"configuration they will have when the constraints are resolved. You can "
"read much more about this subject in the tutorial :doc:`*A study of "
"Studies* <../A_study_of_studies/intro>`."
