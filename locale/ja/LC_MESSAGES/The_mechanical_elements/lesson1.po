"Segments are defined by the AnySeg keyword in AnyScript. They are the "
"rigid bodies on which the system bases its analysis. In a body model, "
"segments are usually bones, but since an AnyBody model often comprises "
"various equipment and other items, segments are also used to model "
"cranks, pedals, handles, tools, sports equipment, tables, chairs, and all"
" the other environmental objects a body may be connected to."

"Segments do not have any particular shape associated with them. By "
"default a segment is originated in its Center of Mass (CoM), but it is "
"possible to move the CoM away from the origin of the segment's reference "
"frame. The mass properties are defined by means of a mass and an inertia "
"tensor. The segments in the picture above visualize their mass properties"
" by ellisoids."

"Another important property of a segment is that it can have nodes, so-"
"called AnyRefNodes, assigned to it. The connections between the segment "
"and the AnyRefNodes are rigid, so the nodes move with the segment. The "
"nodes are visualized by the heads of the pins sticking out from the "
"ellipsoids."
