"Just about every example you find in these tutorials is based on the "
"concept of inverse dynamics, which in some sense is the opposite of "
"forward dynamics. To understand the difference between these two concepts"
" it is useful to have a brief look at Newton's second law. It states the "
"following:"

msgstr ""

"where **F** is the vector of resulting forces acting on a body with mass "
"*m* causing an acceleration vector, **a**. So, if we know the "
"acceleration, i.e. the movement of the system, then we can find the "
"forces acting on it. That is inverse dynamics, and this is why AnyBody "
"usually requires us to specify the movement or posture of the model "
"before it can compute anything for us."

"In this version, if we know the forces, we can determine the movement. "
"This is called forward dynamics. The problem with forward dynamics is "
"that input to the analysis will be some information about the muscle "
"forces and this is usually hard to determine experimentally and even more"
" difficult to guess."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Posture_and_movement/intro.rst:31
msgid ""
"But what if we know neither the movement nor the muscle forces? In that "
"case we have two unknowns and only one equation and it seems like our "
"venture into musculoskeletal analysis is destined to failure no matter "
"what we do. This tutorial shows how the optimization capability in "
"AnyBody can help you solve that kind of problems. They technically go "
"under the name \"Posture and Motion Prediction\" and the idea is that "
"rather than inputting a known posture or movement we want the model to "
"predict how a human body is likely going to move in a given situation. "
"Since this involves optimization and optimization takes time we are going"
" to formulate a very simple problem, but the principle applies to much "
"more complex models as well."

"As the name indicates, in posture and movement optimization we use "
"optimization to compensate for the fact that we do not know the movement "
"a-priori. So, instead of feeding the movement to the analysis we have to "
"feed something into an optimization problem, and that something has to be"
" the ultimate goal of the movement."

msgid ""
"For some movements this goal is quite obvious. The objective of a high "
"jump, for instance, is to jump as high as possible, so we could simply "
"ask the optimizer to determine the movement pattern that leads to the "
"highest possible jump. Of course it would not be allowed to have "
"movements that require more muscle strength than the body has available, "
"so we would also have to formulate a constraint ensuring that the maximum"
" muscle activation stays below 100%."

"For other movements the goal is less clear. If we want to predict the "
"movement of lifting a coffee cup from the table to the mouth then what "
"would a reasonable goal be? The constraints are rather easy: Start at the"
" table, end at the mouth, keep the cup horizontal all the time, avoid "
"accelerations that would spill the coffee and so on, but many different "
"movements would honor those conditions. Which of them would be the one a "
"given person would actually choose? Some investigations indicate that for"
" submaximal tasks like this, a lazyness criterion often applies; we try "
"to get around the task as effortlessly as possible in some sense. But we "
"really do not know. In this case, the user could try different objectives"
" and decide on one that leads to a plausible movement."

"The movement we have imposed is unrealistic. Both joints move with "
"constant angular velocity while, in a realistic case, the model should "
"capture the fact that it is necessary to accelerate the leg from some "
"start position to the velocity it has at impact. To obtain a realistic "
"and \"designable\" movement we have to replace the two simple drivers on "
"the hip and knee with something more general. The interpolation driver is"
" excellent for this purpose because it allows us to determine the "
"position of each joint in certain time steps through the kick and "
"subsequently will interpolate between those loctions to generate a smooth"
" motion."

"A fast reload and run of the model will show that the movement is "

"ensured by using similar values for the first two points in each "
"interpolation, for instance -30 and -30 degrees in the HipDriver. Now we "
"could generate infinitely many different motions simply by inserting "
"different angle values into these interpolation drivers. Among them will "
"be the motion that generates the fastest kick without overloading the "
"muscles. Unfortunately, infinity is a very high number and we could never"
" finish searching for our solution and this is where the optimizer can "

"We already have some data now that can be used in the definition of our "

"optimize? Given that the mass of the foot and football are given in "
"advance we can presume that maximising the velocity of the football after"
" the impact is equivalent to maximizing the velocity of the foot before "
"the impact. In fact, the law of conservation of momentum says something "
"about that. If we presume the mass of the football to be 0.2 kg, the "
"coefficient of restitution of the collision to be 0.5, which is typical "
"for a football kick, and presume that the ball is at rest before impact "
"then we have enough information to predict the velocity of the ball after"
" the impact given the velocity of the foot before the impact. We can "
