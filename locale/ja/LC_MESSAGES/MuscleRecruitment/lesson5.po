"With the exception of the linear criterion, each of the options presented"
" in the previous lessons have produced plausible muscle recruitment "
"patterns. We have found that polynomial criteria of increasing order "
"produce increasing degrees of synergism between the muscles. Maximum "
"synergism would be the case where all muscles capable of a positive "
"contribution to balancing the external load work together in such a way "
"that the maximum relative load of any muscle in the system is as small as"
" possible. This would physiologically be a minimum fatigue criterion "
"because fatigue is likely to happen first in the muscle with the maximum "
"relative load, and it makes physiological sense that the body might work "
"that way. It would mean that the body would maximize its endurance and "
"precisely this criterion might decide survival of the fittest in an "
"environment where organisms are competing with each other for limited "
"resources."

"Mathematically, it turns out that we would get exactly that kind of "
"recruitment if we let the power of the polynomial criterion go to "
"infinity. It would not be numerically possible to do that with the "
"polynomial algorithm we presented in the previous lesson, so it is "
"necessary to use a dedicated algorithm for that purpose. In its pure form"
" it is called MinMaxStrict, and we might as well try it out on the "
"bicycle example right away. It is necessary to change just a little bit "
"in the definition of the study:"

"When comparing with the muscle activation curves we have seen earlier it "
"looks like there are less muscles represented on this one, but that is "
"not actually the case. It just looks like there are fewer curves here "
"because a lot of them are exactly on top of each other. This is a logical"
" consequence of minimizing the maximum muscle activity: when muscles help"
" each other as much as they can, many of them end up with the same "
"activity."

"Min/max recruitment leads to a very well-defined envelope of muscle "
"activation, and it plays an important role in a lot of cases of ergonomic"
" design. It is so important, in fact, that the envelope has its own "
"predefined output variable placed alongside the other global values such "
"in the study:"

"The variable, MaxMuscleActivity, is interesting because the maximally "
"activated muscle(s) in the problem likely determine the perceived effort."
" To illustrate this, think of lifting an average size bag. It may not be "
"difficult to do with your hand, but if you were to grab the handle with "
"your little finger only, then you would perceive the lifting of the bag "
"as rather laborious because its weight would now have to be carried by a "
"much higher maximum muscle activity in much smaller muscles. This means "
"that the maximum muscle activity is a good measure to use in ergonomic "
"design cases where we want to determine a tool or a posture that "
"minimizes the effort of a given work task. Rather than having to review a"
" lot of muscle activations in the entire body we can capture the effort "
"in a single curve as shown above."

"Closer inspection of the curve above shows that the muscle activation "
"peaks at 88.2%. Near the top of the Bike2D file you find the variable "
"SaddleHeight. As the name indicates, it determines the height of the "
"saddle of the bike, or more precisely the vertical distance between the "
"crank shaft and the hip joints. The current value is 0.63 m. Try raising "
"the saddle by 2 cm by the following change:"

"Then load and run the problem again and plot the MaxMuscleActivity. It "
"now peaks at 83.5% indicating that the higher saddle has made it somewhat"
" easier for the rider to pedal the bicycle."

"Notice that the maximum muscle activity is defined for any type of muscle"
" recruitment, but the min/max muscle recruitment illustrates its "
"definition better because it leads to such a clear envelope. Furthermore,"
" because min/max recruitment causes the muscle to cooperate as much as "
"possible, the envelope simulated by this criterion is smaller than or "
"equal to the envelope of any other criterion that can be defined. In "
"terms of maximum muscle activity, the min/max muscle recruitment simply "
"leads to the lowest possible maximum activation by which the external "
"load can be carried. While this may or may not be the way muscle are "
"recruited in reality, it is a better way of assessing ergonomics than "
"most of the other criteria we can think of. If we run the bicycle "
"simulation with AnyBodyâ€™s standard muscle recruitment (third order "
"polynomial with upper bounds on activities) for saddle heights of 0.63 m "
"and 0.65 m and plot the two curves of maximum muscle activation, we can "
"get the following:"

"Notice that because the upper bounds on muscle activation become active, "
"the curves have the same maxima despite the change of saddle height, and "
"the ergonomic advantage of the higher saddle comes out as a smaller area "
"under the red curve compared to the blue."

"The reason why the MinMaxStrict criterion is not the default in AnyBody "
"despite its attractive properties for ergonomic investigations is that it"
" switches muscles in and out very abruptly when they change moment arms "
"from negative to positive. These sudden shifts may sometimes happen "
"faster than physiologically possible and they also mean that muscles with"
" just a marginally positive contribution will be activates to their full "
"potential. As we have seen in the previous sections, lower order "
"polynomial criteria do not have that type of behavior."

"It is tempting to think that there might be a compromise between "
"polynomial and the min/max criterion that would have the attractive "
"properties of both strategies, i.e. get close to the minimum activation "
"or fatigue of the muscle system and also have relatively smooth "
"activation curves. In the next tutorial we shall look at composite "
"criteria that might combine some of the attractive features of the pure "
"criteria we have investigated so far. This takes place in"
