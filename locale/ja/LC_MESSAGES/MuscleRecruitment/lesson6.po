"So far we have investigated recruitment criteria in the form of "
"polynomial sums with degrees ranging from 1 (linear recruitment) to "
"infinity (min/max recruitment). It is not given, however, that any single"
" degree criterion is the right one."

"It seems reasonable that a high order criterion is correct when the "
"external load approaches the limit of the organism’s strength because "
"that enables the organism to use its full strength. On the other hand, it"
" might also be unreasonable that a lot of muscles should be activated if "
"the external load is very small and/or some of the muscles have a very "
"unfavorable moment arm and therefore can contribute very little."

"Praagman et al (2003, 2006) reviewed the physiological mechanisms behind "
"muscle contraction and concluded that there are two energy-consuming "
"processes, namely detachment of cross bridges and re-uptake of calcium. "
"If muscle recruitment is based on minimization of energy, then it is "
"reasonable to think that the objective function contains a contribution "
"from both these processes and they turn out to be represented by an "
"objective function with a linear as well as a quadratic term. To "
"investigate this, let us change the muscle recruitment to the type of "
"quadratic criterion that also accepts a linear term:"
msgstr ""

"…and let us also reduce the power consumption to a level that does not "
"require upper limits on the muscle activation:"

"Loading and running this version will produce the exact same result as "
"the standard quadratic criterion because the weight on the linear term is"
" set to zero. The result looks like this:"

"The muscle synergy is slightly reduced by the linear term in the "
"objective function, and the maximum muscle activation is consequently "
"slightly higher. Is this better than the pure quadratic recruitment? That"
" is difficult to answer, but the option allows a discerning user to "
"influence the recruitment criterion and to build in physiological "
"considerations such as those by Praagman et al."

"The min/max muscle recruitment has a similar alternative form that allows"
" for the addition of a linear or quadratic term to the objective "
"function. In this case the quadratic term turns out to be the more "
"interesting, and it does in fact allow for a recruitment behavior that "
"combines some of the good features of quadratic and min/max recruitments."
" To investigate this in more detail, let us first take a look at the "
"optimization problem that is solved in the min/max muscle recruitment "
"problem. We mentioned before that min/max can be interpreted as a "
"polynomial criterion for which the power is going to infinity. Obviously,"
" the solution of an infinity-powered objective function requires some "
"additional mathematical tricks. The trick is to redefine the muscle "
"recruitment problem to the following form:"

"It is easy to see why this minimizes the maximum muscle activity: The "
"only way to reduce the objective function, :math:`\\beta`, and to honor "
"the constraints is to simultaneously reduce all the muscle activities. "
"The question now is: what happens if we add a quadratic auxiliary term to"
" the objective function, :math:`\\beta`, this way:"

"This appears to produce a combination of soft onset and offset of muscles"
" together with a clearly defined envelope on which several muscles "
"cooperate evenly to carry the load. Please notice, however, that the "
"effect of the Weight property, i.e. the :math:`\\varepsilon` in the "
"objective function, is somewhat problem dependent because the size of the"
" sum that it multiplies depends on the number of muscles in the system "
"while the size of the :math:`\\beta` variable remains between 0 and 1 for"
" normal problems. So models with many muscles would typically require a "
"smaller value of:math:`\\varepsilon`."

"From what we have seen so far, the MinMaxAux criterion looks ideal from a"
" mathematical and physiological point-of-view. Unfortunately, there is "
"one additional, physiological requirement that we have not touched upon, "
"and on the MinMaxAux criterion fails on that. To understand it, let us "
"make a thought experiment:"

"We create a model of a person lifting a box. The mass of the box is 10 "
"kg. The muscle recruitment algorithm will return some distribution of "
"load between the muscles in the system."
msgstr ""

#: ../../MuscleRecruitment/lesson6.rst:163
msgid ""
"Then we change the mass of the box to 5 kg and run the model again. This "
"gives us a different muscle recruitment pattern. Probably the muscles "
"would now be somewhat less loaded than before."
msgstr ""

#: ../../MuscleRecruitment/lesson6.rst:167
msgid ""
"Now we create a model with two people in it. This is entirely possible to"
" do in AnyBody. The two human models are exactly the same as before and "
"one is lifting a 10 kg box, and the other is lifting a 5 kg box. Since "
"the two body models are completely independent from each other, except "
"from the fact that they are present in the same computer model, we would "
"expect the muscle recruitment we get when they are inside a single model "
"to be exactly the same as we got for the two single-body models we had "
"before. And this would be the case with the polynomial criteria of any "
"degree and with the MinMaxStrict criterion, but it would not be the case "
"with the MinMaxAux criterion, and this does not seem to be right."
msgstr ""

#: ../../MuscleRecruitment/lesson6.rst:179
msgid ""
"So the conclusion is that the MinMaxAux criterion, despite its attractive"
" features, should be used with care in models where there is a chance "
"that some model parts are independent of each other."
