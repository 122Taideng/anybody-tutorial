"Muscle recruitment in inverse dynamics is the process of determining "
"which set of muscle forces will balance a given external load. If we take"
" the trouble of setting up the system of equilibrium equations for a "
"musculoskeletal system by hand, then we can organize them on the "
"following form:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../MuscleRecruitment/lesson1.rst:17
msgid ""
"where **f** is a vector of muscle and joint forces, **r** is a vector "
"representing the external forces and inertia forces, and **C** is a "
"matrix of equation coefficients. In other words, equilibrium always "
"results in a linear system of equations that should be easy to solve. "
"Unfortunately, it is not, and this is due to two reasons."
msgstr ""

#: ../../MuscleRecruitment/lesson1.rst:23
msgid ""
"The first reason is that muscles are unilateral element that can only "
"pull and not push. So the part of **r** that is muscle forces is "
"restricted in sign, and only solutions with positive or zero muscle "
"forces are physiologically reasonable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../MuscleRecruitment/lesson1.rst:28
msgid ""
"The second reason is known as muscle redundancy. It is due to the fact "
"that muscle systems tend to have many more muscles than strictly "
"necessary to balance the external forces. The mathematical consequence is"
" that the equilibrium equation above has more unknowns than it has "
"equations and therefore usually infinitely many solutions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../MuscleRecruitment/lesson1.rst:34
msgid ""
"So, is muscle recruitment in the living human body random in the sense "
"that it just chooses the first and the best solution that balances the "
"load? Experiments show that this is not the case. In skilled movements, "
"muscles tend to be recruited systematically, so there is some criterion "
"behind the central nervous system’s choice of muscle activations. "
"Mathematically we can formulate the choice between the infinitely many "
"solutions as an optimization problem in the following way:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../MuscleRecruitment/lesson1.rst:55
msgid ""
"The equilibrium equations are constraints in this problem: whatever "
"solution we find must balance the external forces. The requirement for "
"positive muscle forces has also been added as a constraint to the "
"problem. Only solutions adhering to these two requirements are "
"acceptable, but out of these many solutions we are going to change the "
"one that minimizes the function *G*, and are furthermore going to "
"anticipate that this function depends on the muscle forces. This seems "
"reasonable because muscle recruitment is probably a result of biological "
"adaptation and muscle work is costly for the organism and should be "
"minimized in an environment where resources are limited. Now we just have"
" to figure out what the function *G* actually is and unfortunately there "
"is nobody around who knows it for sure."
msgstr ""

#: ../../MuscleRecruitment/lesson1.rst:68
msgid ""
"So in the following we are going to play around with different choices "
"and see what happens. AnyBody is great for this purpose because the "
"settings of the InverseDynamics operation offer the user a lot of freedom"
" to choose the function he or she believes is the right one for a given "
"purpose."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So let’s get set up with a model that is suitable for experimentation "
"with different definitions of the muscle recruitment problem. We shall "
"begin with one that is very, very simple and work our way upwards from "
"there. Please download right-click this link and save the file in a "
"working area of your hard disk: :download:`Recruitment.Main.any "
"<Downloads/Recruitment.any>`."

"Open the model in the AnyBody Modeling System, load it into memory, open "
"a Model View window, select the InverseDynamics operation, and click the "
"Run button. You should see something like this:"

"Please click Window->Chart (2D) to open up a new window for inspection of"
" results. You can expand the tree on the left hand side of that window "
"and find the muscle force, Fm, somewhere inside the properties of the M1 "
"muscle. When you click it you get a graphical representation of the "
"muscle force:"

"Obviously, AnyBody has solved the equilibrium equations and has "
"determined what the muscle force is at every instant of the simulation "
"time. But which objective function, :math:`G`, has the system used?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../MuscleRecruitment/lesson1.rst:103
msgid ""
"If we review this problem we can see that it has only a single degree of "
"freedom and only a single muscle to carry the load. This actually means "
"that the equilibrium equations are determinate (one degree of freedom and"
" one muscle) and in this case it does no matter what :math:`G` is, so "
"there is little we can do in the settings to influence the result of the "
"analysis. The result is given by equilibrium alone and there is no other "
"muscle force than the one you see in the graph that would be able to "
"balance the model. It does not get really interesting until we apply "
"another muscle. A couple of simple additions to the model will accomplish"
" this. We first add a new origin node on the global reference frame:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../MuscleRecruitment/lesson1.rst:136
msgid ""
"Then we define a second muscle by copying the first one and making a few "
"changes. Notice that the strength of the second muscle is set to half of "
"the strength of the first one:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../MuscleRecruitment/lesson1.rst:167
msgid ""
"Now two muscles will have to cooperate on the task of carrying one degree"
" of freedom. Let us see what AnyBody, in the absence of any special "
"specifications from the user, chooses to do. If you load and run the "
"model, plot the muscle force of M1 as you did before, and then manually "
"place an asterisk in place of the muscle name in the specification line "
"in the Chart window, you should get something like this:"

"We can observe that both muscles are working and that M1, which has the "
"higher strength and better moment arm, is exerting more force than the "
"weaker M2. This seems immediately reasonable from a physiological point-"
"of-view, and this is what you get from AnyBody if you do not make any "
"special specifications. We shall get back to the precise nature of "
"AnyBody’s standard criterion a little later. For now, let us proceed and "
"speculate a bit about what may or may not make physiological sense in"
