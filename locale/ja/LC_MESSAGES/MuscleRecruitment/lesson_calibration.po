"One of the challenges in body modeling is that models must be able to "
"change size to reflect individuals of different statures. Even if you are"
" working on a model of a particular individual, you will almost always "
"want to change the dimensions of the model as you are building it. And if"
" you are developing a generic model to represent a range of body "
"proportions, you are likely to want the model to depend on the "
"anthropometrical parameters you define. For instance, the weight of a "
"segment is often represented as some fraction of the full body weight. "
"Such a property you could make parametric by simply defining it as a "
"function of the full body weight by means of a simple formula."

"But other dimensions are more subtle and difficult to establish as a "
"direct functional dependency of other parameters. Tendon lengths are "
"perhaps the most prominent example. If you are in doubt of the importance"
" of tendon lengths, just try to bend over and touch your toes with your "
"knees stretched. Some of us have hamstring tendons that are so short that"
" we can hardly reach beyond our knees, so tendon lengths directly limit "
"our ranges of motion. But they also influence the working conditions of "
"our muscles even when the muscle-tendon unit is not stretched to its "
"limit, so it is important that we define the muscle tendon unit so that "
"it fits the body model."

"A muscle-tendon unit is attached to at least two segments at its origin "
"and insertion respectively. To make things worse, some muscles span "
"several joints, and most muscles wrap over bones and other tissues with "
"complex geometries on their way from origin to insertion. So, the basic "
"idea behind calibration of tendon lengths in AnyBody is the assumption "
"that each muscle-tendon unit has its optimal length at some particular "
"position of the joints it spans. We simply define one or several studies "
"that put the body model in these positions and adjust the lengths of the "
"tendons to give the attached muscles their optimal lengths in those "
"positions. When you subsequently run an analysis, the system uses the "
"calibrated tendon lengths regardless of how they are defined in the "
"AnyScript file. (This means that you have to run the calibration(s) every"
" time you have reloaded the model if they are to take effect)."

"AnyBody has several different types of muscle models. Some are very "
"simple and contain no strength-length relationship, while others do. It "
"goes almost without saying that the former type is not affected by "
"calibration. If you use one of the latter - more advanced - models, "
"however, calibration may be crucial. If the tendon is too long, the "
"muscle will end up working in an unnaturally contracted state where it "
"has very little strength. If the tendon is too short, the muscle will be "
"stretched, and its passive elasticity will affect the force balance in "
"the system. Since the passive elastic force in a muscle-tendon unit "
"typically grows very rapidly with stretching, a too short tendon can "
"cause very large antagonistic muscle actions."

"Enough talk! Let's define a muscle and calibrate it. We shall begin with "

"As you can see from the comments, the muscle has many parameters you have"
" to set. The significance of each of these is explained in detail in the "
"muscle modeling tutorial. For this model to take effect, we must assign "
"it to the biceps long muscle. It is a little further down in the file, "

"What we have done here is to give BicepsLong a new and more advanced "

"recruitment criteria MR\\_MinMaxStrict, which is better suited for "
"InverseDynamics of overloaded models:"

"This graph shows the muscle force or more precisely the force in the "
"tendon. The force in this more complex muscle model is composed of 3 "
"elements: Fm, the muscle force is the force from the contractile element "
"of the muscle. Parallel to Fm is Fp which is the passive elastic element "
"in the muscle. Conected in series of the muscle, is the tendon where Ft "
"is the elastic tendon force. If you pick the Fp property, you should get "
"the following graph:"

"The parallel-elastic force Fp sets in when the muscle is stretched beyond"
" its optimal fiber length. In the movement of this example, the elbow "
"starts at 90 degrees flexion, and as the graph shows, this gives rise to "
"about 0.7 N of passive force at the beginning of the movement. This "
"indicates that the tendon we have specified is too short. If the movement"
" was extending the elbow instead of flexing it, the passive force would "
"rise. This means that the result of the simulation depends a lot on "
"having the correct length of the tendon. If it is too short, too much of "
"the load will be carried by passive muscle forces. In this example where "
"we have only one muscle with a complex model, it would not be too "
"difficult to adjust the tendon length manually until we get it right, but"
" in models with many muscles, this can be a very tedious task, "
"particularly since it has to be repeated every time the dimensions of the"
" model are changed. Instead, the answer is to let AnyBody calibrate the "
"tendon length automatically."

"AnyBody's advanced muscle model, the AnyMuscleModel3E, is basically a "
"phenomenological model based on the classical works of Hill. It presumes "
"that each muscle has an optimum contraction in which its fibers have "
"their best force-producing capability. To do a simple 1 parameter "
"calibration we would need to know the set of joint positions "
"corresponding to this optimum fiber length for each muscle, then those "
"joint positions were the ones we would be calibrating the muscle in."

"You can see that it has multiple operations. The interesting ones are the"
" two latter: TendonLengthAdjustment and LigamentLengthAdjustment. As the "
"names indicate, they are for tendon and ligament calibration "
"respectively. Notice that the study only has one time step. The model "
"posture in that step should be the position in which you wish to "
"calibrate the tendon. If you run the TendonLengthAdjustment operation you"
" will notice that the model takes the initial posture of the flexion "
"movement it was doing in the InverseDynamics. This is because of the line"

"The ArmModel contains movement drivers, and when they are included in the"
" study they cause the model to attain the same posture in the calibration"
" study as it does in the inverse dynamic analysis. To be able to "
"calibrate in another posture we must perform a small restructuring of the"
" model and perhaps recommend a organizing things a little differently in "
"general when making models."

"We included the movement in the model when we developed it in the "
"\"Getting Started with AnyScript\" tutorial because we wanted things to "
"be simple. But think for a moment about how you would typically want to "
"use models. Let's imagine you have developed a model of a leg. One day "
"you might want to simulate squat, another day perhaps gait, and yet "
"another day a football kick. You would want to use the same model but "
"with different sets of drivers. This speaks in favor of having drivers, "
"loads, and other problem-specific properties outside the folder "
"containing the body model."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Calibration is actually an example of using the same model with two "
"different movements, so we have to place the drivers outside the ArmModel"
" folder. In the editor, highlight the entire Drivers folder, cut it out, "
"and paste it in right below the end of the ArmModel folder like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../MuscleRecruitment/lesson_calibration.rst:248
msgid ""
"Notice that after moving the Drivers folder we have changed the "
"references to the joints. We also have to change the study a little bit. "
"This is because the study points at the ArmModel folder and that no "
"longer contains a movement, so the study would not know how to move the "
"model, unless we add this line:"

"Now we are ready to define a couple of static drivers specifically for "
"calibration of the muscles. We create a CalibrationDrivers folder right "
"below the Drivers folder:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../MuscleRecruitment/lesson_calibration.rst:295

"These drivers are static because their velocities are zero. They specify "
"a posture with the upper arm vertical and the elbow at 30 degrees "
"flexion. Notice the expressions converting degrees to radians."

"The final step is to modify the calibration study is to use the "
"calibration drivers:"

#: ../../MuscleRecruitment/lesson_calibration.rst:312
msgid ""
"What we have now is a study that uses the model together with two static "
"drivers for calibration of the muscles, and a study that uses the model "
"with the previous set of dynamic drivers. If you run the CalibrationStudy"
" TendonLengthAdjustment first, the system will adjust the tendon lengths "
"and remember the values for the until the model is reloaded. Now run the "
"InverseDynamics study and have a look at the chart. Notice that the Fp "
"passive muscle force now is zero because the BicepsLongModel slack length"
" Lt0 was elongated by the calibration."
