"Let us begin this lesson with a physiological observation. We know that "
"there is a metabolic cost involved in development of muscle force. Food "
"is a limited resource for living organisms so it is likely that nature "
"has programmed us to save muscle work in some sense. But exactly how?"

"So we can reduce the load on one muscle, but the cost will be more work "
"remaining for the other muscle to do. It seems that a criterion taking "
"both muscles into account is needed. Let us just briefly recall the "
"formulation of the muscle recruitment problem again:"

"The simplest imaginable choice of objective function taking the effort of"
" both muscles into account seems to be a linear combination like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../MuscleRecruitment/lesson2.rst:45
msgid ""
"i.e., a linear combination of the two muscle forces, where the "
":math:`N_1` and  :math:`N_2` are some choice of normalization factors. "
"Thinking about the physiology we might quickly get the idea that it is "
"reasonable if strong muscles do more work than weak muscles, so "
":math:`N_i` acould be measures of the strength of each muscle. We are "
"going to stick with that idea for the remainder of this tutorial because "
"it actually turns out to make sense also experimentally. We can get "
"AnyBody to work with precisely this definition by making the following "
"additions to our study:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../MuscleRecruitment/lesson2.rst:67
msgid ""
"This small addition specifies that the muscles must be recruited as a "
"linear combination. The muscles forces are automatically normalized by "
"the strengths. Running the analysis and plotting the result as before "
"leaves us with this somewhat surprising result:"

"It seems that the weaker M2 is slacking around doing nothing and leaving "
"all the work to the stronger M1. It turns out that we always get this "
"type of behavior when recruiting muscles with a linear objective "
"function. In general, this method will only recruit the minimum number of"
" muscles to balance the system, and the chosen muscles are those that by "
"combination of their moment arms and strengths are best suited for the "
"purpose. While this might be a reasonable strategy, it is unfortunately "
"totally non-physiological. It is possible to measure activity in muscles "
"electrically, and these measurements show without a doubt that several "
"muscles spanning the same joint share the load between them."

"This type of analysis is excellent for identifying the important muscles "
"in a complex system in a given posture and external load. In complex "
"systems this can be very challenging to determine manually and the result"
" can be useful for a variety of purposes including decisions on tendon "
"transfer surgery."
