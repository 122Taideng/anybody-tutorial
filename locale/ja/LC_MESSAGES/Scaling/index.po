"Musculoskeletal models must be adaptable to sizes and anatomy of various "
"individuals to be useful for product design and to be used for "
"applications, where high geometric accuracy is required, e.g. surface "
"articulations and patient-specific pre-operative planning. A general "
"method for scaling musculoskeletal models has been implemented in the "
"AMMR. It allows the usage of built-in, user-defined anthropometric "
"scaling laws as well as individual segment morphing."

"This tutorial introduces an advanced procedure of model personalization "
"by means of nonlinear morphing for both, bone surface and relevant soft "
"tissue attachment sites, to take a subject-specific shape. In this "
"example, bone geometries segmented from medical images will be used to "
"demonstrate how geometrically accurate subject-specific models can be "
"constructed."
