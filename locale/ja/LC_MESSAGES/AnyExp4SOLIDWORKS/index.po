"This tutorial shows how a CAD model designed in SOLIDWORKS can be "
"imported into AnyBody and interact with the human model. This allows for "
"analysis and optimization of the ergonomics of products."

"AnyBody and SOLIDWORKS is a powerful combination if you want to design "
"and analyze mechanical systems with a close relationship with human. It "
"is convenient to manage the model of your system in the CAD system with "
"its powerful design functionality and then transfer the model to AnyBody "
"for human-integrated mechanical analysis. AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS makes this "
"transfer of the model easy."

"After finalizing your CAD model, then with the AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS add-in "
"you can translate it into a corresponding AnyScript model. This AnyScript"
" model will include all mass properties, initial positions and geometry "
"information of all individual parts in your CAD assembly. Also all the "
"mate information of your CAD assembly will be translated into several "
"corresponding AnyScript constraint objects."
