"The picture below shows the thorax position variation over time recorded "
"by digitizing images from a video capture (model curtesy of the Technical"
" University of Vienna) of ergometer rowing. The red curve is the "
"horizontal position, and the green curve is the vertical position. The "
"lateral position remains zero and is the blue curve. It looks very "
"reasonable, and it does not seem to be infested with significant noise."

"It still looks reasonable except for a suspicion that the maximum "
"velocity around 12 m/s may be a bit high over such a short distance. The "
"system dfferentiates the velocity function to obtain the accelerations, "
"which subsequently according to the second law of Newton will generate "
"forces:"

"This graph still looks nice and smooth, but notice the values: The "
"maximum acceleration is around 300 m/s^2 or 30 g. Notice that this is for"
" the thorax and not a distal segment like a hand or a foot. It is not "
"realistic, and it is in fact an artifact produced by the amplification of"
" small errors in the positional signal through the two subsequent "
"differentiations."

"If you work with recorded movement data, then it is very important to "
"check that the accelerations are within reasonable limits. The movement "
"is input in inverse dynamics, and if the accelerations are unrealistic, "
"then the muscle and joint forces will be too."

"Too high acceerations are usually due to lack of smoothness of the "
"recorded motion data. The solution is often to apply smoothing with a low"
" pass filter to reduce the unrealistic acceleratons."
