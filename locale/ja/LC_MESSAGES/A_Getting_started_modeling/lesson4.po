"With the kinematic analysis in place, we are ready to compute forces and "
"investigate ergonomic properties of the pedal arrangement. We shall "
"presume that the pedal is loaded by a spring, the force of which the leg "
"must overcome when stepping on the pedal. In this lesson, we will step by"
" step define the spring force and look at its effect on the leg."

"A force can be added to any kinematic measure using the AnyForce class. "
"If the kinematic measure is a length (linear), then an AnyForce is a "
"force, and if it is an angle (rotational), the AnyForce automatically "
"becomes a moment. In the present case, we shall add the AnyForce to the "
"kinematic measure of the pedal's hinge (rotational). Let us initially "
"study the measure. Run the “Kinematics” analysis again, open an AnyChart "
"View, and browse your way through the tree to "
"Main.Study.Output.Model.Environment.HingeJoint.Pos. You should see the "
"following graph:"

"The analysis runs in time from zero to one second, and the pedal angle "
"develops in this time from 100 degrees (1.74 rad) to 145 degrees (2.53 "
"rad). Let us presume that the pedal is loaded by a linear spring that is "
"slack at 0 degrees and increases its moment linearly with the rotation of"
" the hinge. We might be wondering: What would be a comfortable spring "
"stiffness for a pedal like that? Not having much experience with pedal "
"design it might be difficult to imagine just how stiff the spring should "
"be, and we could find ourselves developing a series of hardware "
"prototypes with different springs and perhaps conducting subjective "
"investigations with test subjects."

"Let us do it with AnyBody instead. We shall start out by declaring an "
"AnyForce to play the role of the spring. Since this is not a part of the "
"body, it is logical to place it in the Environment.any file. Here's what "
"to add:"

"The AnyForce contains a reference to the HingeJoint. Since the degree of "
"freedom in the HingeJoint is rotational, the force is as described above "
"turned into a moment and applied to the hinge. The specification of F is "
"the actual size of the load. We have made it proportional to the "
"HingeJoint.Pos, which is the hinge angle, and we have initially set the "
"spring stiffness to 0.0 (Nm/degree), to investigate the effect of having "
"no spring before we start adding a spring force. Notice, by the way, the "
"minus sign in front of spring constant. It has no importance now, but "
"when we start adding non-zero stiffness, it will signify that the spring "
"force goes against the angle, i.e. pushes back onto the foot."

"There are just a couple of things we need to do before we can do the "
"InverseDynamicAnalysis operation and compute the forces: All the drivers "
"we added in the previous lesson have motors built into them. This means "
"that whatever force or moment is necessary to perform the movement will "
"be provided by the drivers, and there will be nothing for the muscles to "
"do. Motors in drivers are technically reaction forces, and they can be "
"turned off inside the driver. Let us open the “JointsAndDrivers.any” file"
" and do the following modifications:"

"And you should remove the additional reactions on the pelvis which are "
"created by the Human template. The purpose of these additional reactions "
"on the pelvis is to provide the necessary supports on the human pelvis to"
" run the inverse dynamics if users may not define enough support forces "
"on either both feet or pelvis. But because now this model has an "
"AnyStdJoint which is defined between the "
"Main.Model.Environment.GlobalRef.Hpoint and the pelvis segment, you don’t"
" need to use these additional reactions on the pelvis anymore. You can "
"remove them by commenting out the “Model\\\\Reactions.any” in the main "
