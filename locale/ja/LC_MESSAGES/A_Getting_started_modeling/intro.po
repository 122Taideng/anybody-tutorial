"The objective of this tutorial is to give an understanding of more "
"complex models using a full body model. A model will be created using a "
"template and will be adapted to explain the reaction of the human body to"
" an environment."

"Developing accurate models of the human body is an enormous task, and it "
"is not something each user can do from scratch. We often have to rely on "
"models other people have made, and if we keep improving and exchanging "
"them, we shall end up with an excellent supply of models that fit most "
"purposes. `*The AnyBody Managed Model Repository* "
"<https://www.anybodytech.com/software/model-repository-ammr/>`__ that has"
" been described in a previous chapter is an attempt to provide such a "
"library. Additionally, there are templates available that allow an easy "
"start into a new model application."

"All this can be done very elegantly in the AnyScript language provided "
"you keep it in mind when you construct your models. The AnyBody Model "
"Repository applications and templates are built that way, and they "
"contain numerous examples of the technique. In short, it uses the "
"following elements of the language to make it happen:"

"While there are many different ways models could be constructed to obtain"
" the modularity we are looking for, the AnyScript Model Repository "
"representsÂ one very well-structured solution, and AnyBody Technology "
"strongly recommends following the structure of this library when new "
"models are developed."

"When an existing application is similar enough to what you want to do to "
"form the basis of the new application, then you can just copy that "
"application and modify it as you want. But sometimes it will be clearer "
"to users to build their own models from the bottom-up. We will consider "
"the second situation and try to create a new model using templates."
