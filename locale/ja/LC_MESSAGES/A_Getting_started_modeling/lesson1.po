"In some cases, it may be difficult to find an existing model that is "
"sufficiently similar to what you want to obtain. In such a case it can be"
" reasonable to begin the modeling project from a new model rather than an"
" existing model. This is what we shall explore in the forthcoming "
"lessons. We shall design a model of a **single leg stepping on a pedal**."

"Let us first review the structure of the repository in slightly more "
"detail. One of the objectives of its structure is to enable a clear "
"division between the body parts and the applications we hook them up to. "
"This comes through in the data structure of the model we are going to "
"construct. Here is a brief overview of the principles behind that "
"structure."

"The model is primarily divided into three folders as shown above. In "

"At the top below the “Main” folder, you see the \"HumanModel\". This is "
"where we keep the body parts that we are importing from the Body part of "
"the repository. This folder contains objects such as segments (bones), "
"joints, muscles, and ligaments. We also keep information about the "
"scaling of the model in this folder. In general, you don’t need to modify"
" this information directly."

"Next, you can see the “Model” folder which contains all the information "
"of your model. Below this Model folder, you can find another HumanModel "

"It is just as important to notice what this folder does not contain: "
"movement drivers, forces, and joints between the model and the "
"environment. The external hardware parts of the models such as chairs, "
"bicycles, tools, or, in the present case, a pedal are stored in the "
"“Environment” folder."
