"The **AnyParamStudy** performs an exhaustive search of the variable space"
" computing the model's reaction to every combination of the variables "
"within a given interval. For instance, a parameter study could "
"investigate the metabolic efficiency of a bicycle depending on the "
"horizontal and vertical position of the saddle. The advantage of this "
"study is that it gives you the ultimate overview of the system's "
"behavior. The disadvantage is that the number of computations grows "
"exponentially with the number of parameters. A two-parameter problem with"
" five values of each parameter leads to 5 x 5 = 25 analyses, which is "
"usually no problem to do, while a five parameter problem will lead to 5^5"
" = 3125 analyses, which obviously is a more time-consuming undertaking, "
"at least for larger models."

"The **AnyOptStudy** performs a systematic search within a parameter space"
" using optimization techniques of solutions that fulfill certain "
"criteria. For instance, you could ask the study to find the saddle "
"position that maximizes the metabolic efficiency of the bicycle while "
"keeping the maximum muscle activity below a certain upper limit. The "
"advantage of this study is that it does not need to compute al "
"combinations of the parameters and therefore can handle spaces with "
"multiple parameters within a reasonable time. The disadvantage is that it"
" does not provide the overview of the design space that you get from a "
"parameter study."
