"After loading the model, open a Model View window, select InverseDynamics"
" and then click the Run button. You should see the knee extending and the"
" muscle bulging just like you saw with the baseline model. However, "
"inside the joint, much more is now going on. We can investigate this in "
"detail if we open a ChartFX window and browse down to the linear measure "
"inside the joint:"

"The red curve is the deformation of the joint in the *x* direction, i.e. "
"parallel with the tibial plateau. Despite the stiffness being smaller in "
"this direction, the deformation is rather small. This is of course due to"
" the muscle force acting rather perpendicularly to the tibial plateau."

"The green curve symbolizes the deformation perpendicular to the tibial "
"plateau. It reaches a value of about 4 cm, which is much more than in a "
"real knee. This is because we defined very small stiffness values, "
"precisely to get some large deformations to look at. If you right-click "
"the blue condyle, select ‘Hide” from the context menu and zoom in on the "
"joint, you can see the deformation very clearly as a penetration of the "
"shank part of the joint into the thigh part:"

"At this point, we can reflect a bit on what the FDK solver within the "
"InverseDynamics analysis actually does. Basically, it finds equilibrium "
"for the degrees of freedom that you have specified as 'ForceDep'. It is "
"static equilibrium in the sense that the solver assumes accelerations and"
" velocities of these degrees of freedom to be zero, just like if it had "
"been an ideal joint without motion. This assumption is fair as long as "
"the motion of the degrees of freedom is actually small (negligible); but "
"it is your responsibility to make sure that this is okay for your model. "
"In the current model, it may be disputable whether it is ok, but "
"primarily because we have worked with relatively large deformations for "
"the sake of the example."

"We may call the obtained solution a quasi-static equilibrium because it "
"is indeed static in the direction of the force-dependent degrees of "
"freedom, i.e. the small motions, but it retains all the motion from that "
"large motion of the standard kinematical drivers and the thereof "
"following inertia forces."

"The FDK solver solves the equilibrium equations numerically and therefore"
" it will leave a small residual. You can monitor this residual in the "
"output data; in the figure below you see the curve for the error/residual"

"hand"

"In this example, the error is completely insignificant and within the "
"specified error tolerance "
"(Main.Study.InverseDynamics.ForceDepKin.ForceTol). It can, however, "
"become harder to reach a solution within a very fine accuracy, when "
"models become more complicated and in particular when the stiffness is "
"increased a lot. In other words, the solver will have difficulties when "
"approaching the case of ideal constraints."

"The solver continues with subsequent time steps, even if it does not "
"converge within the specified tolerance. This implies that we can keep "
"the tolerance small and subsequently inspect the time steps for which the"
" solver fails to honor the tolerance."

"In principle, this completes the introduction to AnyBody's FDK solver in "
"this tutorial. The FDK principle is applicable in many different "
"situations where tissue deformations are involved, and models can of "
"course be defined in much more realistic detail than we have seen here. "
"In the fourth lesson of this tutorial, we shall have a look at how to use"
" the simple surface contact force model also available in AnyBody to "
"improve on the kinematical behavior in combination with the FDK solver."
