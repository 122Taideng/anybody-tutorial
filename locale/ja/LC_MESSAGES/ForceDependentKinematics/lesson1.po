"In this lesson we familiarize ourselves with the simple knee model. If "
"you have not already downloaded the model, then please do so from this "
"link: :download:`DemoSimpleKnee.any <Downloads/DemoSimpleKnee.any>`. Save"
" the model to a working area of your hard disk, for instance in "
":file:`Documents\\AnyScripts\\tutorials`. Then open the model in AnyBody,"
" expand “Study” in the Operations Tree, select InverseDynamics and click "
"Run. This is what the model looks like:"

"The yellow segment is the thigh and the red segment is the shank. The "
"thigh is fixed to the ground frame at the hip joint and the thigh and the"
" shank are joint at the knee joint, which in this version of the model is"
" just an idealized revolute joint symbolized by the blue circle. This "
"circle is actually the projection of a cylinder representing the femoral "
"condyles, and over it wraps the single muscle that actuates the system. "
"We can think of this as the quadriceps muscle. You can see the muscle "
"bulging in response to the increased load as the knee extends."

"So far, this is just an ordinary AnyBody model with no special features. "
"In the next lesson we shall see how this model can be upgraded with a "
"more realistic knee joint using the Force dependent kinematics (FDK) "
"solver of the system:"
