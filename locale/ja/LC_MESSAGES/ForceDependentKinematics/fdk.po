"Let us start by looking at the simplest form of Newton’s second law, when"
" it’s written for a point mass particle:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here **F** is the resultant of all forces acting on the particle, *m* is "
"its mass, and **a** is the consequent acceleration. If we knew the values"
" of all the applied forces, the accelerations could be computed and maybe"
" even integrated over time to predict how the particle would move. Such a"
" study of the particle’s physics would be termed a Forward Dynamic "
"Analysis."

"This would be more beneficial when the particle’s accelerations could be "
"observed using say a video camera, but the forces were unknown. This is "
"called an Inverse Dynamic Analysis."

"AnyBody usually performs inverse dynamics since it’s far easier to "
"observe motion visually or with motion capture systems than to do a "
"forward dynamic analysis with a priori estimates of the internal body "
"forces which move to the musculoskeletal system."

"AnyBody extends Newton’s second law to a complex multi-body system "
"consisting of many rigid segments inter-connected through “ideal” "
"mechanical joints. For example, an ideal spherical joint allows 3 degrees"
" of rotational freedom, but constrains the 3 degrees of translational "
"freedom whose violation is vehemently countered by 3 corresponding joint "
"reaction forces."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ForceDependentKinematics/fdk.rst:36
msgid ""
"However, many biomechanical joints are not completely ideal and allow for"
" small motions between the bones. These small motions are both difficult "
"to measure as well as estimate, since they depend on the topology of the "
"bony contact and are often finely stabilized by the muscle and ligament "
"forces. A good example of such a motion is the anterio-posterior sliding "
"of the femur on the tibia at the knee joint."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ForceDependentKinematics/fdk.rst:43
msgid ""
"This means that we cannot determine these motions before we know the "
"internal forces and, as we just saw above, standard inverse dynamics "
"requires the entire system’s motion to be known before we can compute the"
" forces. So we are faced with a classic catch-22 problem. This is where "
"Force-Dependent Kinematics or FDK comes in to save the day!"

"In this tutorial we will construct a very simple model that is easy to "
"understand, and fast to build and analyse. It however permits small "
"motions between the two bones which will really help us understand the "
"detailed functions of real joints. This is what the model will look like:"

"This model is a knee joint extended by a single quadriceps muscle. The "
"joint, however, is somewhat different from the idealized “engineering” "
"revolute joints you often see in musculoskeletal models. It comprises a "
"circular condyle in contact with a flat tibial plateau. The contact is "
"frictionless, so the condyle can in principle freely slide back and forth"
" on the plateau. To stabilize the sliding knee, two perpendicular springs"
" are acting between the femur and tibia."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ForceDependentKinematics/fdk.rst:65
msgid ""
"The first spring is normal to the tibial plateau, and it represents the "
"compressive stiffness of the cartilage between the two parts. The second "
"spring is parallel to the tibial plateau, and it represents the "
"collective effect of the menisci and the ligaments in providing anterio-"
"posterior stability."
