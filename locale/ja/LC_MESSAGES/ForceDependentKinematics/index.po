"The objective of this tutorial is to explain a feature of the AnyBody "
"Modeling System called force-dependent kinematics (FDK). This advanced "
"feature allows the user to alter motion in a joint depending on the "
"acting forces from muscles, ligaments, surfaces, etc."

"FDK is particularly useful for modeling non-conforming joints and it also"
" has important applications for other types of models."
