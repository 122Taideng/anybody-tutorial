"In Lesson4, we have seen how a joint could be constructed by using "
"geometry data of a real bone or implant. Now in this lesson, we shall "
"have a brief look at how such a joint can be used in a complete human "
"body model. Fortunately, this is already done in two examples of the AMMR"
" (version 1.5). Thus, please make sure that you have AMMR 1.5 installed "
"on your computer. You can find the models mentioned under "
"``Application/Examples/THA-KneeBendDemo`` and ``Application/Beta/TKA-"
"KneeBendDemo``."

"The first example is a model of a total hip replacement using a contact "
"between geometries of hip implants, the second one is a model of a total "
"knee replacement where the knee joint is replaced by the contact of knee "
"implant geometries for a femoral and a tibia part. Both examples are "
"models of a knee bend motion. For the sake of simplicity, we concentrate "
"on how the new joint model is inserted in the first, the hip implant "
"model. The knee replacement model works with a similar concept, but it is"
" more complicated and more sensible to make changes in this model, "
"because of delicate balance between joint positioning and ligament "
"tension. It should be noticed that the model contains no easy way to "
"position the knee joint parts, only trial and error, and this is also why"
" the model still resides in the Beta section of the Application models."

"In general, the replacement of a standard joint in the body model by a "
"contact joint can be split into three steps. The first step is to define "
"and position the implants in the model. Looking in the main file, in the "
"bottom, we find the lines"

"Additional to that, we can find the file BoneExchange.any included in the"
" main file. This file exchanges the standard femur bone against a cut "
"version. The only reason to do this is for visualization to see the "
"implant better. It has no impact on the mechanics."

"The second step is, similar to the simple-knee model in the lessons "
"before, the definition of the contact forces. This, we can find under"

"Here, the contact force between the two implant components is defined. "
"Further down we see an artificial force is defined. This is basically a "
"force that should not produce big forces, but which is sometimes needed "
"by the FDK solver to find a solution in cases where the implants are not "
"in contact and ligaments and muscles are slack and do not produce forces."

"After we defined all the forces we need in our contact joint, the last "
"step is to replace the standard joint in the body model by our new "
"contact joint. Basically, this is the same as in the model of Lesson 4 "
"except that now we have to remove the standard joint, which comes with "
"the corresponding body part from the AMMR. All this, the exclusion of the"
" standard joint and the definition of the new joint, we can find in the "
"file HipExchange.any which is included inside the AnyBodyStudy."

"The first part of this file removes the standard joints and drivers for "
"the hip joint from the model. Therefore, all objects which have to do "
"with the definition of this joint are collected using ObjSearch functions"
" which return lists of the mechanical objects. These lists are gathered "
"into a single list of object pointers (AnyObjectPtr). Finally, this list "
"is excluded from the Study using the MechObjectExclude member of the "
"AnyBodyStudy."

"The definition of force dependent drivers works similar to the definition"
" in Lesson 2. The only difference is now, that now we have a full 3D "
"model and so we have to think about which degrees of freedom we want to "
"include as force-dependent. If we look at the drivers of this model, we "
"can see that for this particular model we have 3 force-dependent degrees "
"of freedom in the hip, i.e. all linear constraints of a spherical joint."

"These are all changes that have to be done to this model to implement a "
"contact joint. To see the differences between the standard joint and the "
"contact joint, we can use the define statement USE\\_FDK that switches "
"between the two joint definitions by excluding and including the two last"
" of the three mentioned steps, i.e. the definition of the new joint and "
"the definition of the contact forces."

"As mentioned before, the model TKA-KneeBendDemo uses the same concept to "
"exchange the joints of the knee. The biggest difference is the complexity"
" of the knee joint compared to the hip joint. This makes the model more "
"complicated in the sense that we have to define additional ligaments "
"which constrain the movement in a knee (e.g. PCL, medial and lateral "
"collateral ligaments). These have to be calibrated carefully which makes "
"the model more sensitive to changes."

"To conclude this tutorial, we want to mention some difficulties which "
"might show up while using a contact joint in a model. For modeling "
"contact forces, the used geometries, here the implant STL files, have to "
"be adequately detailed and smooth. That means that the quality of the "
"surfaces is significant for the results of the contact modeling. A few "
"remarks on how to assure a good quality of the surfaces can be found in "
"this :doc:`appendix <fdkappendix>`."
