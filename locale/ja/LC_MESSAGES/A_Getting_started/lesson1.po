"The model repository contains many applications in the Examples folder. A"
" few of these are generic in nature and can serve dual purposes: Either "
"they can be used as they are or they can be modified and become models of"
" something else. In this lesson, we will load the Standing Model as it is"
" and introduce the available options."

"The standing model can be found in the repository under "

"The model automatically balances its posture by means of the ankle angles"
" such that its collective center of mass remains vertically above the "

"model will move slightly backward to maintain the balance."
