"The Standing Model has been set up to have its posture defined by the "
"specification of anatomical angles in the joints. These specifications "
"have been collected in one of the model files, **Mannequin.any**. Scroll "
"down your model file until you come to the point where the Mannequin.any "
"file is included. Here is a step by step description:"

"This file is typical for the AnyScript language in the sense that it is "
"organized in so-called folders, which is a hierarchy formed by the "
"braces. Each pair of braces delimits an independent part of the model "
"with its variables and other definitions and can be seen in the model "
"tree as a folder."

"Everything in this file is contained in the Mannequin folder. It contains"
" specifications of joint angles, movements, and externally applied loads "
"on the body (optional). Each of these specifications is again subdivided "
"into parts for the right and left-hand sides of the body respectively. "
"The first folder, Posture, contains joint angle specifications. You can "
"set any of the joint angles to a reasonable value (in degrees), and when "
"you reload the model, it will change its posture accordingly. Please make"
" sure that the values are as follows:"

msgid ""
"When these parameters are set for the right-hand side, the left-hand side"
" automatically follows along and creates a symmetric posture. This "
"happens because each of the corresponding settings in the Left folder "
"just refers to the settings in the right folder. The ability to do this "
"is an important part of the AnyScript language: Anywhere a number is "
"expected, you can write a reference to a variable instead, or even a "
"mathematical expression, if necessary."

"Further down in the Mannequin.any file you will find the folder "
"PostureVel. This is organized exactly like Posture, but the numbers you "
"specify here are joint angular velocities in degrees per second. For now,"
" please leave all the values in this folder as zero."
