"The AnyBody Modeling System caters to a wide range of users with very "
"different modeling needs. Some may simply want to load and run an "
"existing model, some may need to modify an existing or build their own "

" such new users."

"**Most importantly, it comes with a set of demo models** (eg: MoCap based"
" walking model, cycling etc.) that can serve as a useful learning tool, "
