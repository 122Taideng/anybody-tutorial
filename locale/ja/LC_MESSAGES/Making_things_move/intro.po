"Most biomechanical investigations involve some sort of movement, so "
"getting the model to move in the desired way is at the core of "
"musculoskeletal modeling. The AnyBody Modeling System offers many and "
"rather advanced methods to make this happen. This tutorial explains the "
"basics and some of the more common approaches."

"The figure above is a sequence of superimposed images illustrating a "
"cutting movement. In the AnyBody Model View window, this will of course "
"be an animation. The point of the figure, however, is that the movement "
"is derived from a combination of joint articulations, and this introduces"
" the concept of degrees-of-freedom, which we shall abbreviate in the "
"following as DoF."

"The number of DoFs in a model can be thought of as the number of "
"different articulations the model has. The knee, for instance, is a hinge"
" joint and can only flex or extend with respect to its predefined "
"rotation axis, so this joint provides one DoF to the model. The hip "
"joint, on the other hand, is a spherical joint, so it has three different"
" rotations and therefore provides three DoFs to the model. Anatomically, "
"these three DoFs might be called flexion/extension, abduction/adduction "
"and internal/external rotation, but this is just one possible choice of "
"terminology related to a selected coordinate system. We could choose "
"infinitely many other angle definitions and sequences in the hip. "
"Regardless of the choice there would always only be three independent "
"possibilities, so the concept of DoF is rather general, and we shall "
"explore it in a little more detail in the following on a very simple "
"model."

"Please download and save the file :download:`pendulum.any "
"<Downloads/pendulum.any>` in a working directory. Load the model into "
"AnyBody and open a new model view. You should see a vertical segment with"
" a point at each end. It is, in fact, a pendulum model linked to the "
"global reference frame by a revolute joint at its upper end point. We use"
" this example because it is very simple and has a remote similarity with "
"a human limb."

"A hinged pendulum, like a forearm hinged at the elbow, will have just one"
" DoF. If you unfold the list of operations under MyStudy in the Operation"
" window on the left side of the screen, you can select Kinematics and "
"click the run-button as shown below:"

"The message means that there is one equation missing in the system to "
"define the position of the pendulum. This comes down to the fact that the"
" pendulum has one DoF, i.e. one movement opportunity, and the model does "
"not specify how to move that one DoF. The system has no way of "
"determining which movement to perform before we have specified it."
