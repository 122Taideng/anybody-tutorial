"If you think mechanics is simple, it's probably just because you haven't "
"worked with three-dimensional space yet. The laws of mechanics are pretty"
" easy to comprehend as long as stuff is moving on a one-dimensional line."
" When you go to two dimensions, complications such as rotational inertia "
"and centrifugal forces start to play a role, but the equations are still "
"not very difficult. The third dimension is what complicates things "
"enormously and even to the point that mere kinematics becomes a matter "
"for university scholars. It is quite literally rocket science."

"A system like AnyBody is a tremendous help in this situation because it "
"sets up and handles all the equations inside the system and relieves you "
"of the task of actually handling the mathematics. But the system does not"
" prevent you from creating models where the syntax or semantics of the "
"model is invalid, where segments cannot reach their joints, where the "
"kinematics is undefined, or where there are not enough muscles to balance"
" the forces in the system. You are likely to run into all these problems."

msgid "Load-time errors"
msgstr ""

#: ../../Troubleshooting_anyscript/intro.rst:34
msgid ""
"A load-time error occurs when you load a model by pressing F7 or the M<-S"
" icon on top of each window. This causes the system to attempt a "
"compilation of the model you have in the window, and any errors occurring"
" in this respect are load-time errors."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Troubleshooting_anyscript/intro.rst:39
msgid ""
"Load-time errors are problems with the syntax of the AnyScript model you "
"have authored. Such a model must honor a number of very formal semantic "
"rules to be valid, and if it fails the test of any of those, you will get"
" a load-time error."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Troubleshooting_anyscript/intro.rst:44
msgid ""
"Each possible error that can occur is associated with an error message, "
"and the system will print the message in the message window at the bottom"
" of the screen, for instance like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../Troubleshooting_anyscript/intro.rst:52
msgid "or like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../Troubleshooting_anyscript/intro.rst:58
msgid "or this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../Troubleshooting_anyscript/intro.rst:64
msgid ""
"As you can see, error messages adhere to a certain structure. The first "
"part after ERROR is the file in which the system encountered the error. "
"Notice that this may be a different file from the one you were loading "
"because the main file may spawn to include files during the loading of "
"the model."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Troubleshooting_anyscript/intro.rst:70
msgid ""
"After the file name you find a number in parenthesis. This is the number "
"of the line where the error occurred. If you double-click the file name "
"or the number, the file opens, and the cursor is placed at the line in "
"question. Be sure to click the file name or line number and not the error"
" message."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Troubleshooting_anyscript/intro.rst:76
msgid ""
"After the line number comes the actual specification of the error. With "
"good descriptive error messages and easy access to the error location you"
" should have the problem fixed in no time. Unfortunately things are not "
"always that nice. First of all, the error messages are not always very "
"descriptive. This is a problem the AnyBody Modeling System shares with "
"any other computer language compiler in the market. It is not because "
"programmers specifically want to bother their users. The problem is "
"simply that error messages are generated by a very formal semantic "
"analysis. This makes them very different from the natural human "
"expression of the problem, and they can be difficult for the user to "
"understand. But you can get used to them and people have been known to "
"even grow fond of their conciseness."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Troubleshooting_anyscript/intro.rst:89
msgid ""
"The second and more serious problem is that the error may occur in a "
"totally different location from where it really is. Let's take an "
"example: Suppose by mistake you have included the wrong file like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../Troubleshooting_anyscript/intro.rst:100
msgid ""
"somewhere in the model. When the compiler spawns to the wrong file it is "
"likely to meet statements or references to objects that do not exist. The"
" compiler will report en error in WrongFile.any, but the real error is in"
" the file that included WrongFile.any."

msgid "Forgotten semicolon"
msgstr ""

#: ../../Troubleshooting_anyscript/intro.rst:110
msgid ""
"Every statement in AnyScript must be terminated by a semicolon, and it is"
" easy to forget. The consequence is that the compiler will proceed to the"
" next line and probably report that it has encountered something "
"unexpected there. By closer investigation, the next line may be fully in "
"order, and you get confused. The problem was really on the former line."
msgstr ""

msgid "Unbalanced braces"
msgstr ""

#: ../../Troubleshooting_anyscript/intro.rst:121
msgid ""
"Braces ``{}`` are used to group things together in AnyScript. They must "
"be coherent and balanced, and if you have one too few or one too many it "
"can completely change the structure of the code, and you can get strange "
"error messages. The best remedy is to use consistent indentations in the "
"code. This makes it easy to follow the brace level and spot mistakes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Troubleshooting_anyscript/intro.rst:128
msgid ""
"The AnyScript editor can indent your code automatically. If you select "
"all the text and press Alt-F8, all lines are indented according to the "
"brace level, and this often makes it much easier to see where the problem"
" is. Beware that the missing brace can be in an include file."

msgid "Mix-up of decimal points and commas"
msgstr ""

#: ../../Troubleshooting_anyscript/intro.rst:137
msgid ""
"Some nationalities use decimal commas, and some use decimal points. The "
"AnyBody Modeling System consistently uses decimal points regardless of "
"the nationality settings in your computer. If you type a comma in place "
"of a decimal point, you will get a syntax error."

#: ../../Troubleshooting_anyscript/intro.rst:172
msgid ""
"What the message means is that this type of assignment is not allowed. "
"You may argue that the error message is misleading because '=' is indeed "
"an assignment operator. However, operators in AnyScript are polymorphic, "
"and they are interpreted in the context of the variables they operate on,"
" and for two folders no proper assignment operator exists. So, while "
"rhetorically correct, what the statement really means is that you are "
"missing an ampersand, '&'. Assignment of folders to each other must be by"
" reference like this."
